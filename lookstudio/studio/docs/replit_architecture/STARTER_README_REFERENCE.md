# Infinite Arch Photo Lab — Replit Starter Bundle

This bundle is the canonical starting point for migrating the completed **Infinite Arch Leica Looks v1.2** system into a web-based **Infinite Arch Photo Lab** on Replit, then adding Fujifilm implementations.

## Ground truth

The immutable Leica baseline is:

`reference/leica/v1.2/Infinite_Arch_Leica_Looks_v1.2.zip`

SHA-256:

`1932cb619aeabe3b63bf616f77ffeac94181fa92af2a189f865068aac8f1e83f`

Do **not** reconstruct Leica v1.2 from chat summaries. Read the package itself. The actual v1.2 Look set is:

1. IA Invitation — 1001 — Monochrome
2. IA Witness — 1002 — Monochrome
3. IA Zone — 1003 — Monochrome
4. IA Presence — 1004 — Standard
5. IA Threshold — 1005 — Standard
6. IA American Negative — 1006 — Standard
7. IA Kin — 1007 — Standard
8. IA Natura — 1008 — Standard
9. IA Ember — 1009 — Standard

## Start here in Replit

1. Create a new Replit App.
2. Upload/import this entire ZIP.
3. Open `replit.md` and `AGENT_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md`.
4. Give Replit Agent the contents of `AGENT_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md` as its first instruction.
5. Tell Agent to run `python scripts/verify_authoritative.py` before changing Leica code.
6. Tell Agent to follow `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ORDER.md` exactly.

## Product model

The application is **not a Leica uploader with Fuji bolted on**. It is a camera-independent color platform:

`Infinite Arch Look -> target implementation -> Leica / Fuji / software / DCP/XMP`

The Leica v1.2 system is the proven first target implementation. Fuji is the next target.

## Critical architecture rule

The web app creates, inspects, previews, translates, validates, and downloads
Look artifacts. It does not connect to or install onto cameras. Historical
transport research is preserved outside active product code.
